Description

The scaled up version of the web infrastructure is what i was challenged with in this task. I made sure all SPOFs have been removed and each of the major components (web server, application server, and database servers) have been moved to separate Linux servers. The SSL protection was issured to each server network and load balancer with extra protection from firewall and all of them being monitored.


This Infrastructure specifics

The placement of a firewall between each server.
This increases the protection of each server from unwanted and unauthorized users. This is asigned to every server on the network.



Issues With This Infrastructure
 
High maintenance costs and upkeep cost.
Each major components owning its server means that more servers would have to be bought and the company's electricity bill would rise. More funds would be directed towards buying of servers and paying of electricity cost.
